% -------------------------SMDAO----------------------------
% This section refers to the use of the analysis within a Single/Multidisciplinary Analysis/Optimization 
% In such case, there are options to launch only the DISICPLINE Analysis (to determine the state variables) to be used
% for Coupled problems, or to evaluate several Responses. Moreover, the DVs input file can be read to update the current configuration. 

%Used to determine which kind of call is required SMDAO  (NOSMDAO, STATE, RESPONSE, SENS_ADJOINT, SENS_DIRECT)

% ------------------------ ANALYSIS ---------------------------%

% Analysis type ( NO_ANALYSIS, STEADY, UNSTEADY , EIGENVALUE  )
ANALYSIS= STEADY


% In the case of LINEAR, no restart or previous solution is read. 
% In the case of LINEARIZED, it must be read a solution that acts as starting point about which the problem si linearized
% In the case of NONLINEAR the solution is iterate until Residual converges. 
% Not all analyses are compatible with all types of subanalyses (e.g., EIGENVALE - NONLINEAR)
 
% SubAnalysis type (NO_SUBANALYSIS,  LINEAR, LINEARIZED, NONLINEAR )
SUBANALYSIS= LINEAR

% Maximum number of inner iterations (Default = 1)

% Min value of the residual (log10 of the residual)  (Default = -6)

%
% Number of outer iterations   (Default = 1) 
OUTER_ITER= 1


%----------------  Only for UNSTEADY problems -------

% Time discretization (NOTIME, NEWMARK, GEMM)   (Default = NOTIME) 
TIME_DISCRETIZ= NEWMARK

% Maximum number of time iterations   (Default = 1)
